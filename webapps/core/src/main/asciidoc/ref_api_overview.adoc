== Accessing the service

The BioSamples API is organized around link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer[REST]. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication, HTTP verbs and content-negotiation.

=== Hypermedia

This API uses hypermedia, and resources include links to other resources in their responses. Responses are in
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. API users should
not build links themselves, but should use these links to navigate between resources. Clients should discover resources
and available actions by consuming the `_links`.

Links may be returned in templated form, requiring expansion prior to use. This is primarily true for search resources.
Templated links follow https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570[RFC6570].

Link naming follows a consistent pattern.

* Each resource includes a `self` link. This is the canonical link to the resource, although there may be others
* Individual resources are named with the type name, e.g. `sample`
* Collection resources are named with the plural of the type name in camel case, e.g. `samples`, `curations`, `curationLinks`

=== Content negotiation for data representation

BioSamples is able to serve data using different serializations and provides this functionality through https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation[content negotiation HTTP standard]. Even if *JSON* format is the recommended format for API interactions, in <<content_negotiation_table>> you can find a list of all the currently available data representations in BioSamples

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
|Type
|Header
|Comments

| HTML | `Accept: text/html` |
| JSON | `Accept: application/hal+json` or `Accept: application/json` | [green]#*Recommended*#
| JSON-LD | `Accept: application/ld+json` | Use to serve http://bioschemas.org/[BioSchemas] content
| XML | `Accept: text/xml` or `Accept: application/xml` | [red]#*Soon deprecated*#

== HTTP conventions

=== Authentication
In BioSamples, user authentication and authorization functionalities are supported by the mean of a https://jwt.io/[JWT] token provided in the HTTP request header.
For more information on how authentication works in BioSamples, check the link:/biosamples/docs/guides/authentication[authentication guide].

All our API examples that require a JWT token to be fullfilled, will use `$TOKEN` as a placeholder instead.

=== Supported HTTP verbs
The BioSamples API aims to use appropriate https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods[HTTP verbs] for each action.
Not all the verbs are available in the BioSamples API, and you can check the supported one in the <<supported_verbs>>

[[supported_verbs]]
.BioSamples's API supported verbs table
[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Verb
|Description

|`GET`|Used for retrieving resources
|`POST`|Used for creating resources
|`PUT`|Used to entirely replace resources
|`OPTIONS`|Can be used to determine which verbs can be used for a resource
|`HEAD`|Returns whether a resource is available
|`PATCH`|Used to add structured data (e.g. Antobiogram data) to already existing samples
|===

=== HTTP Status codes
BioSamples uses standard response status code to show the outcome of each HTTP request. You can find a complete reference on
HTTP status codes on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status[MDN web docs]

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Status code
|Description


|`200 OK`|The request completed successfully
|`201 Created`|Returned after successfully creating a new resource with a `POST` request
|`400 Bad Request`|The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information
|`401 Unauthorized`|The request did not include an `Authorization` header
|`403 Forbidden`|You are not permitted to access this resource
|`405 Method Not Allowed`|The request used a method that is not permitted

=== HTTPS vs HTTP
BioSamples content is by default served using the HTTPS protocol. The adoption of HTTPs follows an EMBL-EBI guidelines. You can find some more details about these guidelines in this  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/technology/2017/09/https-by-default/[Technical Services Cluster blog post]
