== Sample Validation

BioSamples uses JSON Schema to validate samples against predefined checklists.
A sample could be either validated against a checklist prior to submission or at the submission time.
Following are the available checklists for validation. In the future all the available checklists in ENA will be included here.

Existing BioSamples checklists:

- link:../../schemas/certification/biosamples-minimal.json[ERC100001] : BioSamples minimal checklist
- link:../../schemas/certification/plant-miappe.json[ERC100002] : Plant MIAPPE checklist

Please refer to the link:../references/api/validate[validation API reference documentation] for examples and API guide.


Please contact the BioSamples team at biosamples@ebi.ac.uk if you want to know more about the
certification service and want to have custom schemas and plans for sample validation
