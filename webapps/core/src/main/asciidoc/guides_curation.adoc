== Sample curation

BioSamples performs automatic curation and supports manual curation to
improve sample data findability. It removes missing values, performs
ontology annotation and text curation through automatic curation. BioSamples also imports curation from other services. The curation rules are described below and updated periodically.

The curation records are stored separately along with the original data. BioSamples applies the curation as separate layers on top of the original data.

=== Automatic curation, remove missing values

Missing values, e.g. "N/A", "none", are removed during submission. See
details
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/docs/guides/recommendations[here].

For example, Field `disease state` contains `N/A` in the original data.

[source,json]
----
"characteristics":{
    "disease state" : [ {
      "text" : "N/A"
    } ],
    "organism" : [ {
      "text" : "Homo sapiens"
    } ]}
----

Field `disease state` is removed during submission.

[source,json]
----
"characteristics":{
    "organism" : [ {
      "text" : "Homo sapiens"
    } ]}
----

=== Automatic curation, ontology annotations

Ontology annotation maps sample attributes to ontology terms. BioSamples
uses https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma/[ZOOMA] to perform automatic
ontology annotation. Only annotations with high mapping confidence are
accepted.

For example, when users submit

[source,json]
----
"characteristics" :{
    "disease state" : [ {
      "text" : "hepatocellular carcinoma"
    } ],
    "organism" : [ {
      "text" : "Homo sapiens"
    } ]
    }
----

BioSamples will automaticly mapp the text to ontology terms.

[source,json]
----
"characteristics" :{
    "disease state" : [ {
          "text" : "hepatocellular carcinoma",
          "ontologyTerms" : [ "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000182" ]
        } ],
        "organism" : [ {
          "text" : "Homo sapiens",
          "ontologyTerms" : [ "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_9606" ]
        } ]
    }
----

The automatic ontology curation skips fields with user-provided ontology
terms.

____
[.emoji]#ðŸ’¡# BioSamples only selects high confidence ontology annotation.
However, the automatic annotation might be inaccurate. Users are
recommended to examine the ontology annotation results manually.
____

=== Automatic curation, text curation

Text curation in Biosamples removes unnecessary special characters, and
corrects typos. For example, when users submit

[source,json]
----
"characteristics" :{
    "disease_state" : [ {
          "text" : "hepatocellular_carcinoma",
          "ontologyTerms" : [ "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000182" ]
        } ],
        "Organism" : [ {
          "text" : "Homo sapiens",
          "ontologyTerms" : [ "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_9606" ]
        } ],
        "tissu": [{
            "text":"liver"
        }]
    }
----

BioSamples removes the underscore in `disease_state`, changes `Organism`
to lower cases, and correct typo in `tissu`.

[source,json]
----
"characteristics" :{
    "disease state" : [ {
          "text" : "hepatocellular_carcinoma",
          "ontologyTerms" : [ "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000182" ]
        } ],
        "organism" : [ {
          "text" : "Homo sapiens",
          "ontologyTerms" : [ "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_9606" ]
        } ],
        "tissue": [{
            "text":"liver"
        }]
    }
----

____
[.emoji]#ðŸ’¡# The automatic text curation is limited to the attribute
names, the attribute values will not be changed.
____

It takes up to 24 hours to generate the curation.

== Manual curation

Users can also provide their manual curation. See details
https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/docs/references/api/submit#_submit_curation_object[here].

== How to find all curation records?

Users can access all curation records by adding `/curationlinks` to the
sample link.

For example, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/SAMEA1607017/curationlinks[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/SAMEA1607017/curationlinks].
returns all curation records of sample `SAMEA1607017`

== How to get uncurated data

Biosamples returns the curated data by default. It is also possible to
download the original data without curation by adding
`.json?curationdomain=` to the sample link.

For example,
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/SAMEA1607017.json?curationdomain=[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/SAMEA1607017.json?curationdomain=] returns the original data of sample `SAMEA1607017`.
