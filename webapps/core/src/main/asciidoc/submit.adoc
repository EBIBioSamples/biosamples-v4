== How to submit BioSamples Database?

We support two submission methods:

1. JSON API (recommended)

We recommend all submissions to BioSamples be made in JSON via our JSON API. 

2. Legacy SampleTab format 

Legacy submissions to BioSamples Database should be in link:st[SampleTab file format]. This is a tab-separated spreadsheet-like text format compatible with popular office tools.

Once you have a SampleTab file, you can use the +++<a th:href="@{/sampletab/validation}">validation Service</a>+++ to ensure it is correct. This will also apply common corrections and ontology mappings that are used to standardise the data.

You can send the validated and corrected SampleTab file by email to mailto:biosamples@ebi.ac.uk[biosamples@ebi.ac.uk]. We aim to respond to submissions within one working day.

Alternatively, we provide a +++<a th:href="@{/sampletab/submission}">submission service</a>+++ for programmatically submitting SampleTab files. Please note that they will not be immediately visible in the web interface, but the assigned accession(s) will be returned immediately as a SampleTab file after the submission.

If you have any questions about these services or would like more information, please contact us at mailto:biosamples@ebi.ac.uk[biosamples@ebi.ac.uk].
